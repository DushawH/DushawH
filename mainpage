    <h1>Hello, My name is Dushaw Hockett II</h1>
    </span> 

    <br>

    <p>I am currently attending Towson University, majoring in Computer Science (Cyber Operations). 
        During my Freshman year, I joined Northrop Grumman in a venture to expand and broaden 
        my horizons in the field 
        of both Software Programming and Cyber Security. When I am not studying 
        I invest my time in hobbies such as playing 
        piano, guitar, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or researching automotive engineering. 
        At school I am also apart of the 
        Cyber Defense Club, where members practice primarily 
        red team activities to sharpen our Cyber Security Skills.</p>
